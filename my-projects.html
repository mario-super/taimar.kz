                <p>The system keeps records of all cardiac surgeries performed in a clinic. Helps to analyze successful cases as well as lethal ones.
                    Enables medical employees to deep dive into details, identify common patterns and better understand what factors lead to
                    successful/unsuccessful outcomes.

                <p>The system allows to capture detailed information about patient, performed surgery, any complications happened during
                    the operation and other medical data.
                </p>
                <img src="img/cardiac-2.png" class="img-thumbnail">
                <p>Based on information inputed, the system will calculate the difficulty-level of operation performed.
                    This information is further used when performing data analysis.
                </p>
                <p>To perform data & analysis, large number of real-time operational dashboards and reports exist in the system. </p>

                <p>Discovered insights help medical employees to quickly react and apply corrective measures.</p>
                <img src="img/cardiac-4.png" class="img-thumbnail">
                <p>Instantly available real-time reports helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each clinic. Which, then leads
                to organizing experience and knowledge sharing sessions as well as special trainings across and between clinics to overcome problems identified.</p>
                <img src="img/cardiac-5.png" class="img-thumbnail">
                <p>Apart of the frontend, the system has special backend for administrative personnel, where different kind of administrative tasks can be
                configured. </p>
